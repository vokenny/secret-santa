# Secret Santa

This Scala application runs from the terminal.

This repo contains my two solutions from December 2019 (originally kept inside my scala-practice repo):
1. My first using random shuffling until there are valid pairings determined by no-one gifting themselves
2. My improved solution assigning them methodically

To run the application, navigate to the project directory and use the following command:

    sbt run

Then follow the instructions in the terminal:
1. Type in the number of participants and their names
2. It will print to terminal the pairings

Similarly, to run tests:

    sbt test
